Description: unix weather application that generates web sites
 wview is a collection of linux/unix daemons which interface with a supported 
 weather station to retrieve archive records (if generated by the station) and 
 current conditions. The archive records are stored in an SQLite3 database. At a 
 configurable interval, wview will utilize the archive history and current 
 conditions to generate weather images (buckets, dials and graphs) and HTML web 
 pages based on user-configurable HTML templates.
