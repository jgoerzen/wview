RELEASE VERSION HISTORY (newest to oldest)
------------------------------------------


5.20.1    03-20-2012
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.12.0 or newer

1)  Modified http rain submission (Wunderground and Weatherforyou) so only the
    "rainin" parameter is sent so daily rain will be correct. 




5.20.0    03-17-2012
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.12.0 or newer

1)  Added "wait_for_time_set" function to most wview start script examples so 
    wview daemons are not started until the system time is set. This applies to
    platforms without a real time clock which must reset their time during 
    startup.

2)  Updated the User Manual section on skin selection to better describe enabling
    extended data generation (UV, ET, radiation).

3)  Updated the debian post install script to try harder to find the default http
    document root location for creation of symbolic links to wviewmgmt and the
    weather home page.

4)  Added new configuration option to optionally disable using the Vantage Pro 
    console archive records and instead autogenerate them from the LOOP data.
    This is how all other stations work. It also supports non-standard console
    interfaces (those not using the datalogger on the console).

5)  Updated the Weatherforyou URL for data submissions.

6)  Fixed bug with DataFeed clients that caused an infinite loop if you
    restarted wview while there was a datafeed client connection.

7)  Fixed bug with Alarm Type configuration introduced in 5.19.0.

8)  Changed TWI station to compute rain fall rate as it is reported to not
    be provided by the station.

9)  Added socket retry logic to the station ethernet interface (used by the
    Vantage Pro IP datalogger and any serial-to-ethernet device).

10) Modified CWOP host name to IP address resolution so that 'getaddrinfo' is
    used instead of 'gethostbyname' and all results are tried in the order they 
    are returned. This requires radlib 2.12.0 or newer.

11) Modified the WH1080 station interface to relax packet header requirements
    so it is compliant with more stations of this type. Also hardened the read
    process to require two consecutive matching reads of any record block.
    Added log text to indicate that bad magic numbers can be resolved by clearing
    the station memory.

12) Added bounds checking for calibrated humidity values so they don't fall
    outside [0, 100].

13) Fixed a bug with datafeed client utilites which incorrectly converted
    ARCHIVE_VALUE_NULL (-100000) when preparing a packet for network transmission.

14) Fixed a bug with wind average computation that overflowed the accumulator
    for very large sample size.

15) Added a default logrotate configuration for APT installs.

16) Fixed a bug introduced with 5.19.0 which caused the wind and windgust values
    to always be the same.

17) Removed requirement for a rain sensor for the WMRUSB stations. Stopped sanity
    check of dewpoint values from WMR console which can vary wildly when the
    temperature is low.

18) Fixed a data size mismatch when the virtual server is used and one end is 
    64-bit and the other end is 32-bit. Modified LOOP_PKT and ARCHIVE_PKT to
    use sized integers (int32_t) defined in stdint.h.

19) Incorporated Debbie P's changes for the debian wview start script so it uses
    start-stop-daemon and supports running wview processes as a non-root user
    specified in a new wview-user config file.

20) Modified wviewmgmt Station page to hide location entry if the station type
    is Davis Vantage Pro. ELEV/LAT/LON are defined in the VP console and not by
    wview.

21) Added configuration item "Default Wind Units" to the wviewmgmt generation
    page. Added support for all tags and graphics to use the selected wind
    units. You can now select one of mph, m/s, knots or km/h for the global
    default wind units in wview.

22) Fixed UV processing for FFFF protocol WMRUSB stations.

23) Added support for last 60 minutes rain ("r"), last 24 hours rain ("p") and
    solar radiation ("L") to CWOP packet submission. The use of "P" (rain since
    local midnight) has been removed in favor of the Madis-preferred rain
    reporting data.

24) Added support for solar radiation and UV to http clients (Wunderground
    and WeatherForYou). If these sensor values are populated they will now
    be transmitted.

25) Added exfoliation skin designed by Matthew Wall.

26) Changed the minimum CWOP reporting interval from 10 to 5 minutes.

27) Added n1otx's example script for fast SQLite3 queries:
    examples/scripts/rainInLastWeek.sh.

28) Added socket recovery logic to the ethernet station medium. Added restart
    logic to the serial medium. Added restart function to the medium abstraction.

29) Changed debian package definition to "Recommends" apache and php-sqlite as
    opposed to "Requires".




5.19.0    05-22-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.11.2 or newer

1)  Added "-f" argument to all processes so they can be run in the foreground
    (i.e., not as daemons). This will facilitate tracing and debugging wview
    processes from the command line.

2)  Added "start-trace" command to the wview start script examples that don't
    use some distro-specific magic to start/stop processes so all processes can 
    be started with strace and run in the foreground. Added section in the User
    Manual to describe the use of strace and the "-f" argument for debugging.

3)  Added an rsyslog config file to the debian APT installation such that wview
    logs are placed in the file /var/log/wview.log. Also added "99-wview.conf"
    to the examples/rsyslog directory and instructions for use in the source 
    build section of the User Manual.

4)  Added alarm type definitions to the Alarm Type mouse over tool tip so they
    can be viewed directly from the wviewmgmt configuration page.

5)  Added release of SIGABRT signal for all process initializations. This allows
    a clean abort for the operating system.

6)  Update WH1080 station interface to better handle potential extraneous data
    on the USB bus.

7)  Moved all calculated values (wind chill, heat index, dew point) to the
    generic station code so they are not computed until after calibrations.

8)  Added new configuration parameter to control if station interface details
    (such as host/port or serial device) are displayed with the station type
    when the tag "!--stationType--" is expanded. The default is "yes". Can be 
    configured on the File Generation page of wviewmgmt.




5.18.6    04-01-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.11.0 or newer

1)  Added more valid magic numbers for WH1080 stations.




5.18.5    03-31-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.11.0 or newer

1)  Fixed NOAA yearly reports missing rain on day that DST starts.

2)  Added read thread to WMRUSB using new radthread facility.

3)  Added email alert when VP archive record has to be retried.



5.18.4    03-26-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.10.3 or newer

1)  Added better WH1080 sensor decode.

2)  Added console reset logic for WMRUSB stations when sensor data stops being
    sent.



5.18.3    03-20-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.10.3 or newer

1)  Fixed TE923 rain decode logic.

2)  Changed WMRUSB device open paradigm to harden the interface for marginal
    USB environments.



5.18.2    03-15-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.10.3 or newer

1)  Fixed WMRUSB UV value decode logic.

2)  Fixed hidapi compile error for OSX.



5.18.1    03-14-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.10.3 or newer

1)  Fixed the hidapi utility to work on armel and powerpc platforms.



5.18.0    03-13-2011
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.10.1 or newer

1)  Added wind rose graphic initially contributed by J. Fiddler and G. Eddy.
    Integrated with html generation. Added to default templates.

2)  Added rsync option "-L" (--copy-links) to command used for ssh file 
    transfers.

3)  Added the ability to test alarm scripts by enabling the test and alarm
    number via wviewmgmt on the Alarms configuration page.

4)  Added a configuration parameter to the Station page to allow 
    enable/disable of DTR toggling for certain station interfaces. Currently
    only the TWI and Vaisala stations use DTR toggling.

5)  Fixed issue with datafeed packets and negative values based on research
    done by P. Sanchez.

6)  Fixed computation of rain/ET cumulative values when preset values are
    provided.

7)  Added new wind speed composite graph contributed by G. Eddy.  Added to all
    Day, Week and Month templates.

8)  Added workaround for TWI single digit negative temperature reporting bug
    contributed by pannetron.

9)  Fixed issue causing stations without ET having the rain dials always 
    render at the highest resolution (contributed by P. Sanchez).

10) Fixed all templates' "images-metric.conf" file so the decimal places
    field for the barometer bucket is "1" instead of "2". "2" was causing
    truncation of the labels.

11) Changed Virtual station connection recovery behavior to never stop trying 
    to reconnect with the remote station when the connection is lost.

12) Added support for the Weatherlink IP datalogger. Updated the station 
    configuration page of wviewmgmt to support Weatherlink IP and more
    coherent display of optional config items based on station type. Cleaned
    up some miscellaneous commands.

13) Added support for the WMRUSB station based on M. Maehre contribution. This
    includes the WMR88, WMR100, WMR100N, WMR200 and WMRS200 stations.
    Added a compatibility layer so libusb-1.0 is used. Added wviewmgmt and
    wviewconfig support. Added new medium abstraction support for USB.

14) Added a quick start guide for FreeBSD "wview-Quick-Start-FreeBSD.html".

15) Added a separate medium abstraction for the USB hidapi. This allows support
    for USB devices in Mac OSX and can be used for linux and FreeBSD as well.
    MEDIUM_USBHID should be used for USB stations whenever possible so the
    station is accessible for all supported operating systems.

16) Added support for the Fine Offset WH1080 station and all of its variants.
    These include: Fine Offset: WH1080, WH1081; Watson: W8681, WX2008; 
    National Geographic: 265 NE; Elecsa: 6975, 6976; Ambient Weather: WS-1080, 
    WS-1090, WS-2080; Tycon: TP1080WC; Jaycar XC0348. Used the new USBHID 
    medium for the interface so it will work on Mac OSX systems.

17) Fixed a bug in the "wvutilsConvertMPSToMPH" utility.

18) Fixed a race condition in the process monitor daemon causing possible
    start up hangs.

19) Added support for the Oregon Scientific WMR88A (not the same protocol as the
    WMR88/WMR100). Uses the USB HID medium. Added wviewmgmt and wviewconfig 
    support.

20) Added support for the Honeywell TE923W station and all of its variants.
    These include: TE923, TE821W, WXR810, DV928 (manufacturers include Hideki,
    Nexus, Mebus, Irox, Honeywell, Cresta). Uses the USB HID interface so it is
    supported for Mac OSX systems.

21) Added generic extra sensor support to various stations and the html generator.
    See the file "parameterlist.txt" or the generated file "parameterlist.htm"
    for details. This changed the LOOP packet structure thus requiring an update
    to both remote and local wview servers for users of the "virtual" station type.

22) Removed use of the "HOST_IS_BIGENDIAN" macro and replaced with "WORDS_BIGENDIAN"
    to support OSX universal binaries (thanks B. Northcott).




5.17.3    05-16-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.10.1 or newer

1)  Changed packet receive timeout action from error to warning. Increased 
    wviewd packet response timeout from 30 to 60 seconds.

2)  Updated User Manual source so it is easier to print. Contributed by 
    D. Merritt.




5.17.2    04-18-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fixed "stormStart" display.

2)  Increased wviewd packet response timeout from 10 to 30 seconds.




5.17.1    04-06-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Increased wviewd response timeout from 2 to 10 seconds.




5.17.0    04-04-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added more verbose logging of WMR918 sensor initialization. Fixed timeout
    value for select call while waiting for first data packets.

2)  Added htmlgend timer to limit the wait time for wviewd data packets once
    requested. If packets are not received the timeout will produce log output
    to indicate a problem.

3)  Add back in the display of time for storm start.

4)  Added user contributed PHP code to do path and file sanity check for certain
    configuration items in wviewmgmt screens. Will indicate problems in red.

5)  Added "From" email address configuration and use for email alerts.




5.16.0    03-28-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added contributed java script code to wviewmgmt so the focus defaults to the
    login page's password entry.

2)  Added contributed moon rise and set utilites and html tags. If you are
    upgrading and you want to add them to your Almanac page, you will have to
    do so manually.

3)  Enhanced alarms datafeed archive sync so new archive records will not be
    sent if archive sync is in progress.

4)  Changed storm start display to use the date format specified during 
    configuration.



5.15.0    03-21-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added daily rain (since midnight) to the wunderground and weatherforyou
    data submissions.

2)  Added station time sync after DST change so stations like the Vantage Pro
    which time stamp archive records will heve the new DST time update in a 
    *timely* manner.

3)  Added a 2 minute timeout argument to rsync for ssh file transfers.




5.14.3    03-02-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Modified NOAA update to use a 30 second offset from midnight to avoid 
    DB resource conflicts at midnight. Simplified update logic and fixed 
    bug introduced in 5.14.2 for NOAA causing alternating update and no 
    update at midnight. 




5.14.2    02-25-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Remove legacy FTP interval definition per rule and replace with one global
    interval value to allow control of the frequency of possible FTP transfers.
    Files are still only transmitted if new. Added more verbose logs describing 
    per file status/action.

2)  Modified NOAA database update logic based on time stamps.

3)  Fixed bug in process monitor preventing restart of the station daemon if the
    wview-binary file included CR or LF.




5.14.1    02-21-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Enhance serial read retry logic for the WS-2300 so the station daemon will
    try harder when serial errors occur.




5.14.0    02-19-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Add user-contributed WS-2300 sensor data validation via multiple sample
    collection. Three "similar" readings are required before each sensor data 
    is stored.

2)  Modified NOAA database behavior to allow replacement of existing NOAA
    records with newer data.




5.12.6    01-31-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fixed ssh rule counter initialization.

2)  Restart apache2 for APT installs (not upgrades) so the php5-sqlite module is
    activated.




5.12.5    01-28-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Modified history rollup utility to better handle database and wview NULL 
    values in station data.

2)  Removed obsolete station type selection during ./configure.

3)  Added final prompt for confirmation before wviewcleardata purges all data.




5.12.4    01-24-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fixed wvhttpd and wvcwopd not setting exit status properly.

2)  Cleaned up some previously contributed generator code.

3)  Added new wviewcleardata utility. This script will purge all archive records
    and delete the dependent databases to allow a clean start. Can be used to
    purge simulator data when ready to "go live" with your weather station.




5.12.3    01-16-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fixed bug in ssh rule processing introduced with popen change. 




5.12.2    01-16-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Changed libcurl connection options including not stomping on SIG_ALARM for
    timeouts (which can skew/disable radlib timers). This was causing the FTP 
    transfer timer to fail when a transfer timeout occurred. Also enabled DNS
    cacheing for libcurl which significantly speeds up file transfers. 




5.12.1    01-14-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added passive mode configuration to the FTP daemon.




5.12.0    01-13-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Change FTP daemon to use libcurl transactions directly, not tnftp. This should
    alleviate any "hangs" waiting on the remote server. tnftp dependency removed.




5.11.0    01-09-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fix log buffer overflow for FTP verbosity.

2)  Modify FTP to execute multiple smaller ftp commands to avoid large command
    lines which may timeout.

3)  Added an FTP marker file indicating the last update time for FTP. This allows 
    only new files to be transferred, saving time and bandwidth.

4)  Added new SSH configuration parameters for remote port number and remote
    ssh login username.

5)  Added ability to automatically update the configuration database during update
    of existing installations when new configuration parameters are added in 
    future releases.




5.10.3    01-05-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fix interrupted system call handling for FTP and SSH popen sessions.




5.10.2    01-03-2010
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Modified build environment to better support cross-development.

2)  Enhanced the FTP daemon to do a better job of logging the command output
    if verbose logging is enabled and the tnftp arguments are changed from "-iV"
    to "-iv". All tnftp stdout/stderr output will now be logged for transfer 
    debugging purposes. The User Manual describes how to do this.

3)  Enhanced the SSH daemon to do a better job of logging the command output
    if verbose logging is enabled. All rsync stdout/stderr output will now be 
    logged for transfer debugging purposes.

4)  Removed conditional build of the HTTP service. It will always be built and
    can be enabled/disabled like any other service.



5.10.1    12-29-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added PHP logic to the system status page so the refresh is 3 seconds while
    starting and 60 seconds otherwise.

2)  Fixed a few html errors in the system_status.php file.

3)  Modified the software identifier string tacked on to the end of CWOP packets.



5.10.0    12-28-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added new status facility so wview processes can report their status and
    meaningful statistics. The status data will be stored in text files in the
    /var/run/wview directory in an "INI" file format. /var/run is transient and
    usually not mounted on any physical media (including flash or SD drives).

2)  Added status information by wview service to the wviewmgmt System Status 
    page. Status, last message and up to 4 service-specific statistics are 
    presented. Modified the page to auto-refresh every 10 seconds.



5.9.5     12-26-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Updated day history table insertion to replace existing records.

2)  Fixed LSB header for debian init.d start script.



5.9.4     12-25-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added "IsBlocking" check for ethernet medium reads.



5.9.3     12-25-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added LSB header to the debian start script.

2)  Fixed debian postinst script to always overwrite the wview-version file.

3)  Added support for wviewd shutdown notification to other daemons if it fails
    initialization and shuts down. "/etc/init.d/wview stop" should still be
    issued to ensure all daemons shutdown (ftp and ssh daemons do not receive
    internal messages and radmrouted must be stopped externally).



5.9.2     12-24-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fixed errant "functions.php" inclusion in the tarball.

2)  Added gawk dependency for the debian package.

3)  Fixed a link in the User Manual.



5.9.1     12-23-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Fixed sqlite3 dependency in debian control file. Fixed install "error" when
    apache2 is not installed.

2)  Updated alarm daemon handling of VP consoleBatteryStatus.



5.9.0     12-22-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.9.0 or newer

1)  Added station support for most Texas Weather Instruments stations. Thanks to 
    David Finster for development and debug support.

2)  Changed alarm datafeed socket to publish LOOP data and archive records in
    support of the new wview virtual station. LOOP and archive packets will now
    be sent in network byte order. Added new utilities to provide host-to-network
    and network-to-host conversion of LOOP and archive packets in datafeed.[ch].
    The start frame for loop data has been changed so the start frame can be used
    as a packet type indicator as both LOOP and archive packets will now be pushed.

3)  Added new station type "Virtual". This allows remote forwarding of one wview 
    installation to another. A wview server connected to a real station can run
    just the wviewd daemon and alarm daemon which will push archive and LOOP data
    to a remote wview server configured as "Virtual" which will receive the archive
    and LOOP data and use it to generate files and html as a normal wview server
    would.

4)  Fixed a bug in htmlHistoryInit which caused the wview-history.sdb database to 
    be filled with NULL records if there was no archive history available. Simply
    delete the $prefix/var/wview/archive/wview-history.sdb file and restart wview.

5)  Cleaned up the debian package generation control files including making
    "radlib-dev" a prerequisite for wview. APT upgrades of the 5.8.0 package
    should be seamless.

6)  Source code: GLC_VALUE_NONE is dead, replaced by ARCHIVE_VALUE_NULL.



5.8.0     12-12-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.5 or newer

1)  Updated Awekas US templates to send proper rain unit.

2)  Added new data tag "--stationName--" (brackets removed) to display the
    station name as configured in wviewmgmt.

3)  Updated build environment to support debian packaging. Added wview debian
    package support. See the new User Manual for details.

4)  Removed use of the HTTP_DOC_ROOT environment variable. Now the install
    location for wviewmgmt will be $(localstatedir)/wviewmgmt. Soft links can
    be used to make this visible in the http server document root as desired.
    $(localstatedir) is /usr/local/var by default.

5)  Added new configuration database creation script for debian package
    installations. It is used by the debian package post-installation script.

6)  Changed the default station type configured from Vantage Pro to Simulator.

7)  Added targets for default generation configuration of "chrome", "standard",
    "US units" to the build. It will not overwrite existing html configuration 
    (based on existence of the wview-conf.sdb file). wviewhtmlconfig will no 
    longer be required outside of the new installation unless a different skin
    or different units are selected.

8)  Reformatted the User Manual wview-User-Manual.html. Removed old references
    and added new content for the debian and MacPorts package installs.



5.7.1     11-14-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.5 or newer

1)  Fixed legacy HILOW retrieval logic so the first hour of rain/ET in a day is 
    not skipped when computing daily rain.



5.7.0     11-12-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Added "install-exec-hook" to Makefile.am and removed "install-env" target.
    Now the old "install-env" tasks will be done automatically after the 
    installation tasks and all can be invoked with "make install". Added 
    "uninstall-hook" target to clean up all "install-exec-hook" data.
    The "uninstall" target should never be used unless all data (including 
    archive) is to be removed.

2)  Changed library search order in the LDFLAGS variable for all processes. This
    ensures that libraries installed by package management systems are used
    before older system-installed libraries.



5.6.4     11-05-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Further clean up of chart labels to support DST strangeness.



5.6.3     11-03-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Changed computed rain rate period to 5 minutes for stations for which it is
    computed.

2)  Fixed example alarm scripts so the path is correct.

3)  Fixed issue in Vantage Pro archive record time stamping when DST "falls back".
    Now all records will be stored in the archive database for Vantage Pro,
    including the "2nd" 1 AM to 2 AM period. All non-archive-generating stations
    were already doing this.

4)  Modified day history chart time labeling to be smarter about DST changes.



5.6.2     10-21-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Fixed bug in Makefile.am which allowed the station type to be overwritten 
    during "make install-env".




5.6.1     10-21-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Updated the User Manual and quick start guides.




5.6.0     10-11-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Added a "scripts" directory to the distribution. Added "wview-install-debian"
    and "wview-upgrade" scripts to the distro.

2)  Incorporated a few more defensive measures and fixed a few return values and
    one transposed "break" statement based on user comments. Thanks David Barto.

3)  Added the HTML page "wview-Debian-Quick-Start.html" to the distribution. It
    describes a very simple method for installation on debian and derivative 
    systems.

4)  Fixed a remaining bug with the day history table population when no data 
    exists for one or more archive periods. Consult the User Manual for how to
    regenerate the day history table.

5)  Added better resolution to email alerts; added support for all stations.




5.5.6     09-24-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Fixed a bug for utilities accessing old WLK database files introduced in 
    5.5.4.




5.5.5     09-22-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Fixed a bug for forecast icons and rules introduced in 5.5.4.

2)  Updated selected log messages to be more user friendly.




5.5.4     09-13-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Fixed a loop boundary bug in htmlgend initialization.

2)  Replaced many non-static source string strcpy invocations to provide better
    defensive coverage of excessively long configuration strings.

3)  Fixed a bug when the proper images.conf format is compromised by user
    configuration error.




5.5.3     08-15-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.4 or newer

1)  Restored WS-2300 serial operation from change made in 5.5.2.




5.5.2     07-21-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.3 or newer

1)  Changed Vantage Pro serial initialization to remove hangup and HW flow 
    control.

2)  Changed internal data structures to not be packed.

3)  Changed SIGCHLD processing to be more robust.




5.5.1     06-14-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Changed UV to float in LOOP structure so decimal precision is not lost.

2)  Add more paranoid sanity checks for NULL archive data.

3)  Remove references to "NOAA" for NOAA-style reports in HTML templates 
    (because it apparently isn't clear wview generated the data?!?).

4)  Updated the User Manual.

5)  Added more sanity checks for data converters.



5.5.0     05-14-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Modified WMR9XX station init so it will exit more gracefully.

2)  Removed the wviewsqld process. Exports to external database servers will now
    be done through the $distro/dbexports scripts.

3)  Improved NOAA initialization process so when there are no records, it doesn't
    try so hard.

4)  Integrated WMR9XX changes to support configurable outside channel (thanks 
    Kevin Cloy).

5)  Split out some NULL value checks for Vantage Pro archive record reception.

6)  Added more boundary tests for image generation so when the user tries to
    generate non-existent sensors, htmlgend will not crash.

7)  Changed wind direction graphs from line graphs to scatter graphs (thanks
    Debbie Pickett).

8)  Fixed errant UV conversions in the generator.

9)  Changed wind direction processing so NULL values are not graphed. Modified
    wind direction archive record creation for non-archive generating stations so 
    it is consistent with VP record creation.

10) Fixed some bucket issues from prior dual units contributions.

11) Updated the wview management site (wviewmgmt) to support network configuration
    on Debian-based distributions. Added automatic upgrade support for wviewPlug
    systems.

12) Enhanced the install-env make target further including setup for Debian-based
    network config.



5.4.0     04-18-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Added new SQLite3-MySQL export scripts. Added $distro/dbexport directory
    to contain the script sources. Version 5.4.x will be the last release containing
    the wviewsqld daemon as it is now deprecated in favor of the wview-mysql-export
    script. Added wview-mysql-create script to allow easy setup of the user, database
    and tables on the MySQL server in preparation for export. Archive, HILOW and
    NOAA tables are exported to the same MySQL database. Updated User Manual
    section on MySQL exports.

2)  Added missing documentation of the default wviewmgmt password in the User
    Manual.

3)  Added marker file support for the archive, hilow and noaa databases so the
    synchronization externally via scripts is facilitated.

4)  Removed sample databases for config and archive and changed the "install-env"
    make target so it generates them. This avoids platform issues of sqlite3 databases.

5)  Modified wvpmond so it reads the wview-binary marker file to know which binary
    name to use for wviewd. wviewd binary names are now appended with the station type.

6)  Added new SQLite3-PostgreSQL export scripts. Added $distro/dbexport directory
    to contain the script sources. Version 5.4.x will be the last release containing
    the wviewsqld daemon as it is now deprecated in favor of the wview-pgsql-export
    script. Added wview-pgsql-create script to allow easy setup of the database
    and tables on the PostgreSQL server in preparation for export. Archive, HILOW and
    NOAA tables are exported to the same PostgreSQL database. Updated User Manual
    section on PostgreSQL exports.

7)  Added vpconfig contributions from Deborah Pickett so the ISS channels can be
    configured. Also adds support for setting rain collector size and wind direction
    calibration.

8)  Commented out SQLite3 pragma attempts to change the journaling mode. Support
    for it is not consistent across SQLite3 versions.



5.3.2     03-27-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Changed behavior of the "install-env" make target so it only copies config
    and run environment examples from the distro if the directories do not exist.
    This means future upgrades will require manual copy or manual rename of the
    config and run directories prior to building the "install-env" target (if
    and when new features are desired).



5.3.1     03-26-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Added SQLite3 version check before applying "journal_mode" pragmas. 



5.3.0     03-25-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Created new wviewmgmt site for distribution. Better site navigation, database 
    updates by page, a new system status page and password protection for site
    pages are a few of the enhancements.

2)  Added support for a new configure environment variable, HTTP_DOC_ROOT. When
    defined prior to invocation of the configure script, the install-env target
    will install wviewmgmt to the http document root specified.

3)  Updated the install-env target for wview build so the $prefix/var/wview/archive
    directory is NOT replaced, but rather updated. This means your existing archive
    database should be preserved and will not require a manual copy from the save 
    directory after the installation.

4)  Modified HILOW database population so that archive records are now always added
    as a sample (except for cumulative sensors rain, ET and hail). This avoids the
    missing of the high wind value in the archive record and LOOP data during the
    interval not catching the high wind value. This only applies to Vantage Pro 
    stations.

5)  Changed initial start of sync timer so it cannot inadvertently track with the
    archive interval timer.



5.2.0     03-12-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Changed station build procedure so all station binaries are built with unique
    names such as wviewd_vpro, wviewd_wxt510, etc. Modified the wviewmgmt and
    wviewconfig configuration utilities to populate the file 
    $prefix/etc/wview/wview-binary with the appropriate wviewd binary name; 
    changed all start scripts to use the contents of this file when starting.

2)  Moved the ConfigForms directory out of $distro/examples to $distro/wviewmgmt
    and added automake logic so it is aware of the install prefix and opens the 
    wview-conf.sdb file directly (no soft link required). Added the ability 
    (with sudo membership for the http user) to start and stop wview from the 
    Management web interface.

3)  Moved NOAA data from the ASCII file noaa.dat to an SQLite3 database, 
    wview-noaa.sdb. Modified NOAA generation to use the new API. See the User
    Manual for a schema description.

4)  Added email alert notifications. Added configuration support in wviewmgmt
    and added new config parameters to the example wview-conf.sdb database. See
    the UPGRADE file for instructions. Sendmail and sendEmail packages are required.

5)  Added All Time html tags and sensor support. Added new tags to the almanac
    template examples.

6)  Fixed a bug in VP LOOP data reception logic which caused UV samples to be
    a factor of 10 too large.

7)  Fixed a bug in html generation caused by old DST code that pre-dated the new
    SQLite archive database and the use of unix time for the records.



5.1.3     03-03-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Added hilowcreate to the distribution - it was erroneously left out of the
    prior two builds.



5.1.2     03-03-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Fixed a bug for Vantage Pro stations which only occured if there were no
    records in the wview-archive.sdb database (new install) which caused the 
    wviewd daemon to never retrieve archive records because of a bad 
    LastArchiveTime value (retrying archive record...).



5.1.1     03-01-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Added an out-of-band utility to create the HILOW database so that limited
    power platforms like the NSLU2 can create the new database while the older 
    version continues to archive data and generate files from templates. See
    the UPGRADE file for full details on the process.



5.1.0     03-01-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Added new HTML/Javascript/PHP forms for wview configuration. They are found
    at $distro/examples/ConfigForms. That entire directory should be copied
    to your web server document root. The entry point is 
    /ConfigForms/wview-form.php. Hooks were included for parameter value checking
    but for now whatever you enter is what gets put in the wview-conf.sdb database.
    A link to $prefix/etc/wview/wview-conf.sdb must be placed in the /ConfigForms
    directory with proper rw permissions.

2)  Added new database to store HILOW data, wview-hilow.sdb. Hourly highs and lows 
    are stored along with timestamps for the events, an accumulator and the number
    of samples included (average = accumulator/samples). There is a separate table
    for each sensor type and one record per hour is maintained from the beginning
    of archive records to the current time. sensorstore.bin is no longer required.
    This will also allow for implementation of all-time highs, lows and averages
    in the near future. Note that the initial creation of this database will occur
    the first time wview runs and will take some time according to how far back
    your archive records go.

3)  Fixed bug in computed data utility for archive records which was still using
    the old WLK 0-15 wind direction scheme for a validation check.

4)  Fixed a 1 second delay in file generation introduced when the pre/post generation
    zombie bug was fixed.

5)  Added more checks to the station time sync routine so time syncs are never 
    done at the top of the hour.



5.0.1     02-07-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Fixed bug in alarms configuration processing introduced with the sqlite 
    configuration database.



5.0.0     02-05-2009
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.8.2 or newer

1)  Replaced use of multiple text files for wview configuration with one SQLite3
    database.  There are multiple ways to configure wview now including some new
    graphical choices.  See the User Manual section on configuration for full 
    details.

2)  Replaced the use of the "WLK" database files with the use of one SQLite3
    database. Added conversion utilities wlk2sqlite and sqlite2wlk to allow the 
    import of old WLK records into the SQLite3 archive database. Added the
    dbsqlite.[ch] utility in common to provide the archive database access.

3)  Updated the Awekas template files per changes by Othmar Gattringer.

4)  Segregated rain tipper support to the VP station code. Cleaned up history
    data storage and references. Cleaned up internal archive data processing and
    made it more generic (less VP-specific). Moved WLK utility dbfiles.[ch] under
    the VP-specific station code to retain for the conversion utilities.

5)  Updated sensor utility and added magic number to the sensorstore.bin file
    so when the magic number is changed between versions, wview will automatically
    regenerate the sensor store.

6)  Removed configurability of the archive path. It will now always be at
    $prefix/var/wview/archive.

7)  Autogenerate CWOP passcode for non-CW/DW stations (Gerry Creager).

8)  Updated index page templates to support year selections through 2050.

9)  Updated computed data utility to use new dbsqlite API.

10) Modified wviewconfig to update the SQLite3 configuration database directly
    through the use of the sqlite3 utility, other unix tools and some fancy 
    scripting.

11) Added WMR9x8 support for extra sensors and the undocumented pool sensor 
    (thanks to Kevin Cloy).

12) Added support for new radlib red-black text search utility for data tag
    matching.

13) Added 12-hour temperature accumulator so the 12 hour average temperature can
    be used for pressure conversions.

14) Added support for a dayHistory table in the archive database so once daily
    averages have been computed for historical purposes, they can be stored in
    the database and retrieved to save repeated calculation during startup.

15) Fortified SIGCHILD handling in all signal handlers to mitigate race condition
    with the subsequent signal assignment (thanks Graham Eddy).

16) Changed how station pressure values are calibrated. Instead of calibrating
    each of BP, SP and ALT independently, only the pressure type produced by your
    station needs to be calibrated and the other two are computed based on the
    calibrated sensor value. To date, all stations except the VP produce SP; the
    VP produces BP. Thus only SP (or BP for VP) need to be calibrated.



4.0.1     07-03-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.5 or newer

1)  Fixed nuisance bug in FTP status logging - did not effect performance.

2)  Fixed "Rain Units are mm" message appearing during boot when imperial units
    are selected.



4.0.0     06-28-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.5 or newer

1)  Adjusted rain rate accumulator window for the WS-2300.

2)  Add rain rate accumulator to the WMR918 station as the reported rain rate
    from the station is inferior.

3)  Changed default source location for ftp transfers from $prefix/var/wview
    to $prefix/var/wview/img so by default no "img" directory will be tacked on
    to the destination directory. This will require all users of ftp to modify 
    their wviewftp.conf file to remove all leading "img" references.

4)  Added tipper size support for Vantage Pro stations. The calibration solution
    for VP stations with non-0.1" tippers did not work because of the VP protocol
    inconsistencies. Now no calibration is required to support any VP tipper
    size.

5)  Enhanced dual unit support in charts and buckets (thanks W. Krenn). Unit 
    names must be those indicated in the example images.conf and 
    images-metric.conf files. English is the only language supported for dual
    units at this time.

6)  Added new html tags for various wind units (thanks W. Krenn). See 
    parameterlist.txt for details.

7)  Added a new html template "parameterlist.htx" which includes every html tag
    displayed as "<tag name>=TAG_VALUE". Can be accessed at:
    http://<your_weather_url>/parameterlist.htm.

8)  Modified conversion of Sea Level Pressure (SLP) to Station Pressure (SP) in
    wvutils. This should correct deviations at higher elevations.

9)  Fixed homepage templates for all skins (plus) so the !--localRadarURL-- and
    !--localForecastURL-- tags are used.

10) Added the new chrome skin based on work by M. Nausch.

11) Fixed a bug with rain and ET aggregate values for charts so that values across
    midnight are not displayed incorrectly.



3.9.0     04-20-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.5 or newer

1)  Modify for new unsigned long long radTimeGetMSSinceEpoch return value. You 
    must update your version of radlib to 2.7.5 BEFORE upgrading to this version
    of wview.

2)  Added new station support for the Oregon Scientific WMR918/968 stations. The
    WMR918/968 is selected during the "configure" step by specifying 
    "--enable-station-wmr918". Added battery status HTML tags for the four
    WMR918 transmitters.

3)  Added example alarm script "outtempMaxEmail.sh" to illustrate how to use
    alarm scripts to send notification emails.

4)  Added checks for unpopulated wind gust speed.

5)  Fixed bug where wviewsqld expected SQLDB_EXTENDED_INFO to be defined in all
    cases when in fact it is only valid for VP with extra sensors.



3.8.0     04-01-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.4 or newer

1)  Added basic sensor calibration support such that a multiplier and constant
    are defined for each of the sensors which can be calibrated. Added a new
    config file "calibrate.conf" to allow configuration of the calibration. Now
    (for example) calibration of the rain collector type is possible: 0.01", 
    0.2mm, 0.1mm and others can be supported. Station pressure deviations can
    be calibrated. Allows ratio and/or constant calibrations.

2)  Fix input bug in vpinstall script so configuration is only done if 'y' is
    entered.

3)  Fix strcmp bug in alarms configuration.

4)  Remove barometer trend indicator from automatic inclusion with barometer 
    value during generation.

5)  Fixed a bug in dbfStoreArchiveRecord which allowed the "dashed" value of
    255 through as a valid wind reading for VP stations.

6)  Fixed a bug in the station simulator so no serial fd is added to the wviewd
    file descriptor list.

7)  Added additional console wakeup try for VP archive retrieval.

8)  Changed station time sync interval from every 1 hour to every 4 hours.



3.7.3     03-22-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.4 or newer

1)  Fixed "exec-prefix" bug in wview start script generation.

2)  Added support for generation of NOAA reports in metric units.

3)  Added support for a new "pre-generate.sh" script which, if it exists in
    $prefix/etc/wview, will be executed after image generation but before 
    template generation. Added to the classic/standard and classic/plus skins.



3.7.2     03-18-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.4 or newer

1)  Fixed MaxWindSpeed bug in the WS-2300 interface.

2)  Fixed wviewconfig bug introduced with stationType addition in 3.7.1 which
    omits position configuration for non-VP stations.

3)  Fixed small bug in alarms error logging if the script execution fails.



3.7.1     03-17-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.4 or newer

1)  Enabled NOAA generation for metric stations.

2)  Fixed bug in wviewconfig which prevented non-standard database names for SQL
    setup.

3)  Fixed start script generation to use $exec-prefix instead of $prefix for 
    "WVIEW_INSTALL_DIR".

4)  Clarified text for "STATION_RAIN_ET_YTD_YEAR" config value to indicate the 
    year is the year of the rain season start.

5)  Added new tag !--stationType-- so the weather station type can be produced
    for html pages, etc. Modified wviewconfig to allow for specification of the 
    station type. Removed "Generic" type and added "Simulator", "WXT510" and
    "WS-2300". Added to classic skin homepages.



3.7.0     03-09-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.3 or newer

1)  Fixed missing config file blocks in htmlGenerateInit.

2)  Added transparency level values to graphics.conf and support for all
    graphic types (thanks to Jon Barber).

3)  Fixed bugs in endian conversion utilities (thanks to Michael Puckett and
    Jerry Fiddler).

4)  Added dual unit buckets (thanks to Randy Miller).  This is presently only
	available on non-metric systems and is selected during configuration.

5)  Changed CWOP submission logic to only send a packet if a new archive record 
    has been received. Changed the report interval from a hard-coded 10 minutes
    to be the station archive interval, with a minimum duration of 10 minutes.

6)  Added new wview.conf parameters to configure preset values for rain and ET.
    This allows the display of current conditions to include rain/ET accumulated
    outside of the data in archive records for the specified year. Added support 
    in wviewconfig.

7)  Added support for a "static" directory to be included in site skins. The
    contents of this directory will be copied to the HTML destination once when
    wviewhtmlconfig is run.

8)  Changed location of wview configuration and data trees from /etc/wview and
    /var/wview to $prefix/etc/wview and $prefix/var/wview respectively. This
    allows wview to be installed at any prefix specified during the configure 
    process (--prefix=/opt/local for example). Binary files were already being
    installed to $prefix. This allows wview to be installed/run in a chroot jail
    if so desired (or required by package management systems).

9)  Enhanced example start scripts so they are populated with the proper paths
    for binaries and the data directory based on the configure $prefix during
    the build process.

10) Added new station support for the La Crosse WS-2300 series stations. The
    WS-2300 is selected during the "configure" step by specifying 
    "--enable-station-ws2300". Added rain rate computation for the WS-2300 as it
    does not provide it.

11) Update DST change handling to recompute the sun rise/set etc. data when a
    daylight savings time event occurs.



3.6.0     02-23-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.2 or newer

1)  Added new config file "graphics.conf" to define alternate graphics colors
    and sizes. Added support in htmlGenerate.c for these definitions (thanks to
    Brooks Clark). Made "graphics.conf" part of skin definitions so graphics 
    can be customized by skin designers.

2)  Added "post-generate.sh" and "images-user.conf" to skin definitions so post-
    generation and image customization can be defined by skin designers.

3)  Updated "examples/html/Template-Skins-HOWTO.txt" to reflect changes and better
    describe the skin creation process.

4)  Moved the destination directory for NOAA and ARC pages to ".../NOAA" and
    ".../Archive" respectively.

5)  Fixed bug introduced in delayed CWOP submission logic of 3.5.0 release.

6)  Added support for image background transparency (configured in graphics.conf).

7)  Fixed missing change for the "htmlmgrReReadImageFiles" method so it no longer
    looks for "images-metric.conf" if a metric station (images-metric.conf is
    now copied to images.conf by wviewhtmlconfig based on your wviewconfig
    choices).



3.5.0     02-12-2008
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.2 or newer

1)  Changed CWOP generation logic so that packets are sent every 10 minutes and
    the transmission offset is based on the last digit/character of the APRS 
    call sign.  Call signs with a character in the last position will have a
    transmission offset based on the ASCII value of the character, i.e. a final
    character of "A" would have a transmission offset of: 
    'A' = 65 => 65 % 10 = 5, thus the offset is 5.  No effort was made to 
    support the 9 or 11 minute interval for transmission offsets of 0 as this 
    algorithm will evenly distribute CWOP transmissions over any 10 minute
    interval so long as the callsigns are distributed uniformly. Also changed the
    default servers to all be "cwop.aprs.net" per recent requirements.

2)  Added a new HTML configuration script "wviewhtmlconfig" to simplify template
    setup for US/metric and standard/extended data settings.  It must be run 
    immediately after "wviewconfig". Moved old example templates to
    examples/html/classic/standard and /examples/html/classic/plus and added
    a HOWTO in examples/html for contribution of new template skins.

3)  Changed the format of the "wviewftp.conf" file so that the FTP binary and
    arguments can be configured there rather than hard-coded.

4)  Added config value SQLDB_FULL_SYNC to allow choice of either full sync of
    all archive data or partial sync from last database entry.  The partial
    sync option should allow those with lots of data or slow links to be up 
    and running more quickly.



3.4.1     12-22-2007
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.1 or newer

1)  Fixed make target "install-env" so the html template directory is properly 
    created.

2)  Updated new include templates to support "plus" pages more completely.

3)  Modify WXT510 station interface so it does not over-write the heating 
    configuration. Heating enable/disable must be done outside of wview.



3.4.0     12-16-2007
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.1 or newer

1)  Added new meta-tag for file inclusion: !--include filename.xxx--. If this 
    tag is found in any template file, then htmlgend will attempt to open the
    file at /var/wview/img/filename.xxx and place its contents in the file
    being generated (if your default output location is different from the
    default location of /var/wview/img, htmlgend will look in your destination
    folder). Included files can themselves be generated from templates, just
    place them before the template file which includes them in 
    html-templates.conf (htmlgend generates them in the order found in this conf
    file).

2)  Added new wview process, wvpmond, to monitor other wview processes and 
    kill/restart ones which have become non-responsive (such as wvhttpd).
    Added new config file (processes.conf) so the user can set the timeout
    values for each process or to disable monitoring for that process. Created 
    new wview start scripts to include the wvpmond process.

3)  Fixed bug in htmlgend introduced with the post-generate enhancement which
    caused messages sent to htmlgend to not be received until the next 
    generation timer expiry.

4)  Moved default html templates from "examples/html" to "examples/html/classic".
    This will allow the future addition of other "skins" to the distribution as
    users contribute them. Modified html templates to utilize newly added 
    include files for navigation buttons, headers and current reading tables. 
    Removed redundant old template files which only differed by the background 
    image. Modified the example html-templates.conf to include (and thus
    generate) these new template include files. Changed the default homepage
    behavior to use the "day/night" paradigm.

5)  Added a timeout value to the configuration of libcurl transactions for
    wunderground data submission. This may prevent transactions from "hanging"
    when the wunderground servers are non-responsive.
    
6)  Renamed the wunderground process to "wvhttpd" and added support for the 
    weatherforyou system. wunderground and/or weatherforyou are enabled during
    configuration by specifying "--enable-http". They may be disabled in the
    new http.conf file by setting their station IDs to 0.

7)  Modified the former "wunderground.conf" (now "http.conf") to include 
    weatherforyou settings. Modified wviewconfig to support configuration of 
    weatherforyou.

8)  Modified the Vantage Pro station state machine to only log being in the 
    error state one time to avoid continuous system logging.



3.3.0     05-28-2007
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.7.0 or newer

1)  Fixed wunderground verbose log output (no change to wunderground data sent).

2)  Changed rain dials to only use ET if the station is configured for extended
    data samples.

3)  Fixed rain and ET amounts being rounded up when interval amount is added - 
    sprintf was doing the rounding up. Was only an issue on WXT-510 stations.

4)  Added "withmysql" make target to the sample-datafeed-client Makefile so the
    example could be built with MySQL support.

5)  Added DATE_FORMAT config value in htmlgen.conf to allow user-defined date
    format in images and tags.  Formats allowed are those defined by strftime(3).
    If the value is not present in the config file, mm/dd/yyyy will be used for
    non-metric systems, or yyyymmdd for metric systems.

6)  Added DIAL_TEMP_FEELSLIKE_DISABLE macro to htmlGenerate.[ch] so that if the
    caller passes this value for the "feelsLike" argument, no apparent 
    temperature will be drawn for the htmlGenPngDialTemperature method.

7)  Changed default CWOP servers and port numbers to match new APRS servers 
    specified by Dave Helms.

8)  Verified 64-bit operation with radlib versions 2.7.0 and up.

9)  Added new html tags for !--windGustSpeed-- and !--windGustDirectionDegrees--
    which allow access to the "current" (this term is of course relative) wind
    gust speed and direction.

10) Added new html tags for !--windBeaufortScale-- (which represents the current
    windspeed) and !--intervalAvgBeaufortScale-- (which represents the last 
    archive interval windspeed).  Added wvutils routine to convert windspeed in 
    mph to a Beaufort string.  See parameterlist.txt for the exact tag 
    expressions to use in your templates.  Added "Recent Avg Wind" and "Recent
    Beaufort Scale" rows to all the "index" templates.

11) Added a post-generation script for the htmlgend daemon.  It will be run
    (if found at /etc/wview/post-generate.sh) after all template files have 
    been generated, each time they are generated.  Added an empty script file
    to the distribution (examples/conf/post-generate.sh) and support for it in 
    the "install-env" make target.



3.2.1     03-16-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.2 or newer

1)  Modified example images-metric(-mm).conf files to use zero decimal places
    for the weekly barometer chart.

2)  Modified VP state machine to better detect and handle missed archive records.

3)  Added support for the WXT-510 extra sensors to the Alarms processing.

4)  Added two new HTML tags: --localRadarURL-- and --localForecastURL--. Added 
    support for configuring them in wviewconfig and producing them in htmlgend. 
    Added references to them in all of the homepage (index*.htx) templates. See
    examples/html/index.htx for example usage.

5)  Fixed a bug in the common file for the endian conversion utilities.




3.2.0     03-05-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.2 or newer

1)  Added more logic to handle system time changes with respect to archive 
    record generation. Also enhanced html generator to better handle missing 
    archive records.

2)  Added endian conversion utilities for WLK and sensor archive files:
    arc_be2le and arc_le2be. These utilities will convert all WLK and sensor 
    store files in a given source directory then store the results in a given
    destination directory. The conversions are Big Endian to Little Endian and
    Little Endian to Big Endian respectively and can be run from either a big or
    little endian system.

3)  Added weekly historical chart support. Added image definitions in the three
    images config files. Added new HTML templates for Weekly and Weekly_Plus.
    Added references to the new weekly pages in the other template navigation 
    bars. Added reference to the weekly page in the home page templates. You 
    will need a full template and config file upgrade to properly deploy weekly
    charts (make install-env).

4)  Fixed SuSE wview start script radmrouted invocation.

5)  Added generic ".[your_ext]x" => ".[your_ext]" template file generation 
    support. Any template file with extension ending in 'x' will be generated 
    without the trailing 'x'. Thus, example.phpx is generated as example.php.
    Note: wview will search for tags in these templates and replace them without
          any regard for a particular file/scripting syntax.

6)  Added archive retrieval retry logic to the VP station interface to address
    VP consoles which do not have a record ready when it should be.




3.1.4     02-11-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.2 or newer

1)  Added station altimeter computation support. Changed CWOP submission (again)
    to provide Altimeter value instead of Station Pressure. Added new HTML tag
    --altimeter-- and associated support.

2)  Removed "set -e" from NSLU2 wview start script so it behaves properly.

3)  Changed logic for parsing the *directory* entry of the wviewftp.conf file.
    It appears that "isdigit" was not functioning as expected on the NSLU2.




3.1.3     02-05-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.2 or newer

1)  Fixed rain dial scale calculation for metric stations.

2)  Changed images-metric-mm.conf to use 0 decimal places for rain charts.




3.1.2     02-03-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.2 or newer

1)  Fixed several hour/day/week "change" values for temp, dewpoint and barometer
    introduced with the LOOP data change to float.

2)  Changed rain dials to be zero-based if there is no ET measurement.

3)  Added mm support to the rain dials, buckets, and historical charts. 

4)  Fixed rain accumulator bug for WXT-510 archive records.




3.1.1     01-30-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.2 or newer

1)  Fixed a rain HTML tag value reporting bug in the WXT-510 station support.

2)  Fixed a couple of "Plus" references missing in some of the Plus templates.

3)  Changed the HUP signal behavior for log verbosity to just toggle logging 
    on/off instead of rereading the wview.conf file. Thus the logging can be 
    turned on/off individually for each daemon run time without touching the 
    default in wview.conf.

4)  Changed significant LOOP structure data to type float to get away from the 
    VP "shifted" shorts.

5)  Changed use of the VERBOSE_MSGS config value in wview.conf to be a bitmask
    representing each of the wview daemons. This allows controlling the log 
    verbosity individually for each wview daemon. The config Value should now be 
    8 characters of zeros or ones but if the value is less than 8 characters, 
    the old global setting will be used to maintain backward compatibility. See
    the distro example wview.conf file for a description of the bitmask.

6)  Fixed big endian bug (Mac) in new VP loop processing code.




3.1.0     01-28-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.1 or newer

1)  Added station support for the Vaisala WXT-510 in stations/WXT510. Added 
    content to the User Manual for enabling the WXT510 during configuration 
    and setting it up. Added the wxt510config utility to set up the serial 
    parameters for the WXT-510.

2)  Fixed a bug with the moon phase calculator.

3)  Fixed a potential race condition at startup which could allow html 
    generation before the first LOOP cycle had been completed by wviewd.

4)  Added station support for the Simulator station in stations/Simulator. 
    Added content to the User Manual for enabling the Simulated Station during
    configuration and setting it up. Now wview can be demonstrated/tested 
    without connectivity to a physical station.

5)  Added SIGHUP support to wviewd, htmlgend, wviewftpd, wviewsshd and wvalarmd 
    so this signal can be sent to cause the log verbosity setting to be reread.
    The configuration value VERBOSE_MSGS in wview.conf should be changed prior 
    to sending the HUP signal(s).
    For htmlgend, the image and html config files are also reloaded - this 
    allows the user to change images.conf, images-user.conf, images-metric.conf,
    html-templates.conf and (if supported) forecast.conf without having to 
    restart wview.
    It can be invoked individually for each process with these commands: 
    kill -s HUP `cat /var/wview/wviewd.pid`
    kill -s HUP `cat /var/wview/htmlgend.pid`
    kill -s HUP `cat /var/wview/wviewftpd.pid`
    kill -s HUP `cat /var/wview/wviewsshd.pid`
    kill -s HUP `cat /var/wview/wvalarmd.pid`

6)  Added FTP configuration ability to specify a relative path from the FTP 
    login directory to which the wview-generated files will be transferred. 
    Added commented out example in distro wviewftp.conf-no-ftp file. If the new
    config parameter is not found, all FTP transfers will be placed in the FTP 
    login directory (the old behavior).

7)  Modified the elevation HTML tag to be populated with meters instead of feet
    if a metric station.

8)  Added contributed code to allow selection of cm or mm for rain display if
    the station is metric. Added new htmlgen.conf parameter "METRIC_USE_RAIN_MM"
    to control this option. Added support in wviewconfig.

9)  Fixed CWOP/Wunderground rain reporting bug introduced by the station
    abstraction changes in 3.0.0.

10) Added wvutilsCalculateSLP to calculate sea level pressure (barometric 
    pressure) from station pressure.

11) Added new wview.conf config parameters "STATION_RAIN_STORM_TRIGGER_START"
    and "STATION_RAIN_STORM_IDLE_STOP" and support for them in the wviewconfig
    script. Changed the rainStorm utility to use the user-configurable values.

12) Changed CWOP submission so it uses Station Pressure instead of sea level or
    Barometric Pressure. This is what CWOP really wants. For the case of the 
    Vantage Pro, the same algorithm used to create Barometric Pressure from 
    Station Pressure on stations like the WXT-510 is used with negative 
    elevation to generate the station pressure value to send to CWOP. This 
    corrects a long-standing problem with Vantage Pro CWOP participants 
    reporting sea level pressure instead of station pressure. Added an HTML tag 
    for Station Pressure (!--stationPressure--). This does not modify what is 
    displayed for the !--barom-- HTML tag (sea level pressure).




3.0.0     01-15-2006
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.1 or newer

1)  Added support for new HTML tags --stationDateMetric--, --dailyRainMM-- and 
    --baromTrend--. See parameterlist.txt for the exact tag expressions to use 
    in your templates.

2)  Added AWEKAS support. Added html template files awekas_wl.htx-us and
    awekas_wl.htx-metric to the examples/html directory in the distro and added
    a new User Manual section for setting up AWEKAS with wview.

3)  Totally reorganized and rewrote the station interface code to abstract the
    station interface. This is done in preparation for Vaisala WXT510 support in
    wview. The daemon directory is gone, replaced with a stations directory 
    which contains a common directory for all station-generic code and a
    VantagePro directory for the Vantage Pro-specific interface code. Care was
    taken to minimize the code required for station-specific interfaces to ease
    the implementation of new stations in the future.

4)  Added a new station interface API in stations.h. Clearly defines the 
    functions which must be implemented for specific station implementations.

5)  Added a new storm rain API (stormRain.[ch]). wview now computes rain storm
    events based on a 0.05"/hour rain rate start trigger and an idle (no rain)
    condition of 12 hours to determine when the storm ends. Vantage Pro storm
    values are no longer used so this is available for all station types. Added
    a new HTML tag --stormStart-- which retrieves the storm start date/time.

6)  Added a new sensor API (sensor.[ch]). This provides a robust API for storing
    and retrieving sensor highs, lows and averages for any time frame (hour, 
    day, week, month, year).

7)  Significantly enhanced the computed data API to use the sensor API for HILOW
    data storage. HILOW computation and storage are now done generically by 
    wview - the Vantage Pro HILOW packet is no longer used. Sensor HILOW values
    are exported to a binary file in the archive directory so they can be 
    restored when wview is restarted.

8)  Added a new sun/civil/astronomical rise and set API. This includes a method
    for "midday" and "day length". New HTML tags were added to access these new
    values. The Vantage Pro sunrise and sunset values are no longer used so that
    these values are available for all station types.

9)  Renamed all HTML templates and references so that they do not contain the
    words "Vantage Pro".

10) Enhanced the wviewconfig script so that it queries for station type and 
    does station-aware configuration.

11) Added new HTML tag --forecastIconFile-- which just inserts the name of the
    icon file without any HTML img helper text.

12) Added native wview support for Rain Season Start Month. Added new parameter
    to wview.conf and support in the wviewconfig script so it will create the 
    entry in wview.conf if it is not there. This only effects Yearly rain, ET 
    and rain rate calculation. Added a new HTML tag --rainSeasonStart-- so the 
    start month can be used in templates. Added it to all example home page 
    templates and the alamanac template.

13) Added sanity check logic and requirement to the station initialization so 
    that the station/user config setting for archive interval matches the 
    interval found in the archive files. Startup will not continue if they do 
    not match. This prevents accidental corruption of the archive files.

14) Added new HTML tags --intervalAvgWindSpeed-- and --intervalAvgWindChill--
    along with the code to support them. These provide the most recent archive 
    interval average values for wind speed and wind chill.

15) Reorganized the User Manual and added content to the Building and 
    Troubleshooting sections. Added new content to the UPGRADE file.

16) Enhanced almanac, Current, Daily, Monthly and Yearly HTML templates to
    include java buttons at the top of the page for site navigation. Created
    alamanac_Plus.htx so it may be migrated in the same way the other files are
    for extended sensor support. Updated the example html-templates.conf file.
    Removed the davisticker applet.




2.0.0     12-28-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.1 or newer

1)  Added support for HTML tags soilMoist1, soilMoist2, leafWet1 and leafWet2.
    See parameterlist.txt for the exact tag expressions to use in your templates.

2)  Added support for computation of the daily high wind direction and a 
    corresponding new HTML tag dayhighwinddir. Also added displaying a high wind 
    direction "tick" on the wind dial.

3)  Improved the resolution of the HTML tag windDirection from 8 possible values 
    to 16.

4)  Added new SQL background process which synchronizes the SQL table (if 
    SQLDB_ENABLE is enabled in wview.conf) to the entire WLK binary database 
    even if the records were stored before SQL was enabled. By running the SQL 
    interface in the background as a separate process, it eliminates possible 
    problems with wviewd VP console timing that could have been introduced by
    inserting the SQL records inline from the wviewd process. Uses existing 
    SQL configuration values in wview.conf. You must install the appropriate new
    wview start script for your platform so the new wviewsqld process is started
    when SQL archiving is enabled.

5)  Added configurability of the Moon Phase text. New parameters were added to 
    htmlgen.conf and to the wviewconfig script to support using different words
    or languages for "Waxing", "Waning" and "Full". Should be configured with
    the wviewconfig script.

6)  Optimized dial graphics generation by creating a gd dial palette file during
    initialization and using that run-time to avoid re-drawing the dial circle 
    for every image. 25% or better improvement in overall generation times.

7)  Addressed a rare scenario which could cause wviewd to not send an archive
    notification to wviewd, wvcwopd and wvhttpd when a new archive record is 
    stored. The VP console was indicating an empty archive page. This would 
    cause chart data to "fall behind" by an archive interval and CWOP/
    Wunderground packets to not be sent every time the scenario occurred. 
    Archive record storage was not affected.

8)  Enhanced the "Precip" dials so that gross and net precipitation are depicted.
    Gross is measured rainfall and net is rainfall minus ET. This should clear 
    up any confusion concerning "rain vs. precip".




1.9.1     12-18-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.0 or newer

1)  Added support for hosting wview on the Linksys NSLU2. Created an ipkg 
    repository on the wviewweather.com site so wview and prerequisites (including
    an assortment of USB drivers) can be easily installed from the NSLU2 ipkg 
    utility. See the new User Manual section "Using a Linksys NSLU2 as the wview 
    Host" for full details.

2)  Fixed a memory leak in dbdatabase.c for SQL record insertions which caused 
    the memory used by wviewd to gradually grow in size. This only affects those 
    who have "SQLDB_ENABLE" enabled in wview.conf.

3)  Changed archive receive processing so if the VP console fails to send the 
    next archive page wviewd will cancel the download and proceed with the 
    HILOW request.




1.9.0     12-09-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.6.0 or newer

1)  Changed all wview interprocess messaging to use the new radlib message 
    router utility. Cleaned up message type definition and broke out request
    types to a separate enumeration. You MUST upgrade your radlib installation 
    to 2.6.0 or higher before building/installing this version of wview. You 
    MUST also copy the appropriate wview run script from the 1.9.0 distribution
    for your platform (examples/SuSE, examples/FedoraCore, examples/FreeBSD, 
    examples/MacOSX/wview, etc.). The new wview run script starts the radlib 
    message router first which is now required by the wview processes. See the 
    User Manual section "4.6  Configure to run at system boot" for details.

2)  Fixed a bug in computed data processing when wview is run with a new station 
    that only has archive records for the current day.



1.8.6     12-03-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.5.0 or newer

1)  Added a new configuration parameter "DO_RXCHECK" to wview.conf which 
    enables/disables the generation of receive check stats for the rxcheck.png 
    chart (which indicates wireless receive quality). If the parameter is not 
    found at startup, wviewd will assume it is enabled (the old behavior).
    Added support for this parameter to the wviewconfig script and added it to
    the example wview.conf file in the distro.

2)  Changed CWOP temperature reporting so it rounds up (or down for negative 
    temps) instead of truncating fractional values. Also changed so it will 
    report negative temperatures.

3)  Modified the wakeup console routines to be more robust in certain odd USB
    scenarios.




1.8.5     11-27-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.5.0 or newer

1)  Fixed a bug in the computation of temperature and dewpoint change values 
    for hour, day and week when the wview system is metric. It was computing 
    the absolute celsius value for 1 degree F change instead of the celsius 
    equivalent for one degree F (5/9 of a degree C).

2)  Added composite inside temperature and humidity chart support for the last 
    day and month. You will need to update your /etc/wview/images.conf (or 
    images-metric.conf) file with the new (commented out) entries found in the 
    example config file in the distribution (examples/conf/images.conf). New
    chart images (intempdaycomp.png and intempmonthcomp.png) were not added to 
    any example HTML templates - you will need to do that manually if desired.
    Examples can be seen at: http://www.weather.teel.ws/intempdaycomp.png and
    http://www.weather.teel.ws/intempmonthcomp.png.

3)  Added XML template and generation support. wview now recognizes XML 
    templates (*.xtx) and generates files with extension "xml" from them. Added 
    a default RSS feed for current conditions to all home page templates. Added 
    a new XML template file "wxrss.xtx" to the examples/html directory of the 
    distro and added an entry for it to examples/conf/html-templates.conf. The 
    template file can be copied to your /etc/wview/html directory and edited for 
    your site and preferences. Be sure to add an entry like the one now in 
    examples/conf/html-templates.conf for "wxrss.xtx" in your 
    /etc/wview/html-templates.conf file so the XML file will be generated.




1.8.4     11-13-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.5.0 or newer

1)  Changed all build targets to used shared libraries instead of static if 
    they are available. This fixes build problems on Mac OSX.

2)  Added new wviewd configuration value "SQLDB_DB_NAME" to allow configuration 
    of the database name used for MySQL/PostGreSQL archive record storage. 
    Added support for this new parameter in the wviewconfig script and to the 
    example wview.conf file in ./examples. If the new parameter is not found in
    wview.conf, it will default to the old hard-coded value of "wviewDB".

3)  Fixed a bug in images.c for month rain and ET charts that could occur at 
    midnight.




1.8.3     11-05-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.5.0 or newer

1)  Changed all references to LIST and LIST_ID to RADLIST and RADLIST_ID
    respectively to avoid namespace conflicts with newer versions of MySQL, 
    which only recently started using the same name. You must upgrade to 
    radlib 2.5.0 or higher before installing this version.

2)  Improved DST change processing by adding a timer to allow the kernel GMT 
    offset to be reset properly before re-initializing the history data and 
    resetting the VP console time and GMT offset. Fixed a minor bug that caused 
    history data to be added in cases where the VP console reports new archive
    records but they are actually not new.

3)  Modified some build settings to work properly with the new radlib (libtool)
    build method. Modified all start scripts to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
    environment variable.




1.8.2     10-22-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.3.0

1)  Changed archive record storage so that the bucket type indicator for 0.01
    inches is stored in the rain field (0x1000). This is moot for wview, but 
    is important for weatherlink.

2)  Changed HTML file generation so it will continue generating files even if 
    a missing template file is encountered. It will now just log a warning 
    message.

3)  Added GMT offset configuration of the VP console, done each time the 
    station time is synchronized. The VP console GMT offset is set to the same 
    value as the wview host system and DST is turned off on the VP console as
    the GMT offset already reflects the state of Daylight Savings Time. This 
    corrects many problems folks have had getting their Sunrise and Sunset 
    values to be reported correctly by the VP console (assuming the wview host 
    is configured properly for time zone).




1.8.1     10-01-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.5

1)  Fixed potential divide-by-zero bug in vpifGetRXCheck function.

2)  Added better data integrity checking to the computed data utilities.

3)  Added Debian start script.

4)  Added generation of a simple current conditions text file to be used for 
    mesonet submission. The file generated is mesonet.txt.




1.8.0     09-24-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.5

1)  Increased buffer sizes for FTP username and password.

2)  Changed FTP to use malloc heap instead of radlib buffers for static rules
    and work area.

3)  Cleaned up format and comments for the example html-templates.conf config 
    file.




1.7.8     09-13-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.5

1)  Changed database timestamp format to something pgresql 8+ likes.




1.7.7     09-02-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Fixed wview start scripts so they don't fail for those who don't build the
    Weather Underground daemon.

2)  More tweaking of the NOAA high and low determination.

3)  Fixed a compiler warning introduced with the rxcheck image addition. 




1.7.6     09-01-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Fixed bug introduced with NOAA changes for 1.7.5. 




1.7.5     08-31-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Changed NOAA file generation to use low and high outside temps from archive 
    records instead of the outsideTemp value for lows and highs.

2)  Added newer example message log output for the User Manual Troubleshooting
    section.

3)  Cleaned up "departure from normal" values being displayed as "-0.0" when
    there are no previous year's months to use.




1.7.4     08-22-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Changed yearly number of records counter for yearly average computation
    from a USHORT to a UINT (it was rolling over today 8/22). Changed month 
    and day counter sizes just to be on the safe side.




1.7.3     08-21-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Fixed air density calculation for older compilers.




1.7.2     08-20-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Added new HTML tags for day/month/year high THSW/Radiation/UV plus time of
    day for the daily highs. See examples/html/parameterlist.txt for details.

2)  Updated build environment for MacOSX PostgreSQL builds. Updated the 
    wview-Quick-Start-MacOSX.html file to include a hint for system shared 
    memory configuration.

3)  Added new HTML tag <!--moonPhase--> for moon phase and corresponding new 
    source file to calculate it: lunarCycle.c. Embedded users may want to avoid
    this tag as it uses significant floating-point and trigonometric 
    calculations.

4)  Added new HTML tags <!--airDensity--> and <!--airDensityUnit> for air
    density and corresponding new source code to calculate it. Added new HTML 
    tags <!--cumulusBase--> and <!--cumulusBaseUnit> for estimated cumulus 
    cloud base (in feet or meters). Added table entries for these two values 
    to all example home page templates.

5)  Added new diagnostic chart and supporting VP interface code and data 
    storage to display the percentage of good packets received from the ISS 
    for each archive interval. Added new image definition in images.conf (and
    images-metric.conf) for the rxcheck.png image file. Upgraders will need to
    either copy the new image file definition to their /etc/wview/images.conf 
    from the examples/conf/images.conf file, or copy the distro file over their 
    file if they have not customized the images to be generated. The RX packet 
    chart can be accessed at: http://[your_weather_site_url]/rxcheck.png.

6)  Added three new precipitation dials which combine rain and ET for a "net 
    precipitation" measurement. Day, Month and Year dials added to all example 
    home page templates. Added new image definitions in images.conf (and
    images-metric.conf) for the 3 precip image files. Upgraders will need to
    either copy the new image file definitions to their /etc/wview/images.conf 
    from the examples/conf/images.conf file, or copy the distro file over their 
    file if they have not customized the images to be generated. Embedded users 
    may want to avoid enabling these images as they reqiure significant 
    floating-point and trigonometric calculations.




1.7.1     08-14-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Fixed MacOSX byte swap bug introduced by a copy-paste for the new HILOW 
    HTML tag implementation.




1.7.0     08-14-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.4

1)  Changed all invocations of the system call "localtime" with the more 
    thread-safe version "localtime_r".

2)  Added wunderground interface support. New daemon wvhttpd, new config file 
    wvwunder.conf-no-wunder and new support in the wviewconfig script. Added 
    conditional build/inclusion support in the configure script - 
    "--enable-wunderground" must be given to the configure script to enable 
    building the wvhttpd daemon which also has a new prerequisite library 
    requirement: libcurl. Thus curl (which includes libcurl) must be installed
    if you want to submit data to the Weather Underground. See the new 
    "Weather Underground" section in the User Manual for details.

3)  Added a host of new HTML tags and corresponding data computation and 
    storage. These tags address "holes" in the standard data points provided by
    the Vantage Pro console/protocol. Hour/day/week/month/year wind run is just
    one example. Also included tags for min/max monthly and yearly event dates.
    See the file ./examples/html/parameterlist.txt for a complete list of all 
    the new tags (70 + of them).

4)  Created a new HTML template file, "almanac.htx", which utilizes the majority
    of the new HTML tags to display comprehensive weather information in one 
    easy-to-read place. Hour/Day/Week change values and averages are among the 
    new data values diaplayed. Added a new java button to the homepage templates
    labeled "Almanac" which links to this new page.

5)  Cleaned up some extraneous decimal points for values which did not require
    decimal point resolution when displaying some HTML tag values.




1.6.3     08-02-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.3

1)  Added a Quick Start Guide for MacOSX users.

2)  Added an example startup directory compliant with MacOSX in ./examples/MacOSX.

3)  Modified the vpinstall script generation to dynamically determine the location 
    of vpconfig based on the prefix given to the configure script. It will now 
    work for MacOSX installs.




1.6.2     07-26-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.3

1)  Added a big endian version of vpinterface.c (vpinterface-be.c) to support 
    the VP console interface on big endian systems such as the PowerPC (Mac). 
    Added a configure script test for endianess and conditional inclusion of 
    the little or big endian version of vpinterface based on the results of 
    the configure test. See http://www.wviewweather.com/sites/index.html for 
    a new example Mac OSX 10.3.9 site.

2)  Added new HTML tags for inside temperature and humidity. See the file 
    parameterlist.txt for the new tag names.




1.6.1     07-17-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.2

1)  Fixed a bug in the wvcwopd signal handler when shutting it down.

2)  Simplified html generator timer logic to tighten up generation to occur 
    at 10 seconds past the minute.




1.6.0     07-14-2005
--------------------

radlib version required: 2.2.2

1)  Added CWOP (Citizen Weather Observer Program) support. Properly formatted 
    APRS CWOP data packets are transmitted to the user-defined APRS server 
    with the arrival of each new archive record. Thus archive interval drives 
    how often the CWOP data is updated. This allows wview to send a valid High 
    Wind Speed value for the last archive interval, something Weatherlink does 
    not populate at all.
    Added new process wvcwopd and new configuration file wvcwop.conf. Added 
    CWOP configuration to the wviewconfig script. This facility is disabled or 
    enabled in the same manner as the other wview optional facilities - if the 
    config file is not found, the wvcwopd daemon exits, thus disabling CWOP 
    support. See the User Manual for full details on enabling CWOP support.
    Supports the APRS-IS Rollover functionality by enforcing the definition of 
    3 APRS-IS server:port pairs - the goal is to avoid data loss to the CWOP 
    system caused by connection errors.

2)  Changed how the ARCREC generator behaves at startup so it does not 
    regenerate files which already exist, other than the current day.




1.5.0     07-10-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.2.1

1)  Added archive record browser file generation (arcrecGenerate.[ch]). Added 
    a new configuration parameter for htmlgen.conf named 
    ARCHIVE_BROWSER_FILES_TO_KEEP which indicates the number of days (or files 
    as each file is one day's archive records) to keep in the generation 
    destination (usually your weather site document root). If 0, all files are 
    kept (~ 20 KB per file) and if -1, the files are not generated at all.
    As promised, this new configuration parameter is optional and if not found 
    wview will default to disabled. Also added support for this new parameter 
    in the wviewconfig script - I don't know how we ever lived without this 
    script!

2)  Fixed a minor annoyance when archive averages were being computed where 
    an entire "period" would be skipped if the first record time was not the 
    expected time (missing archive records because of comms failure or battery 
    failure). This caused "holes" in the chart data erroneously. Now if there 
    are *any* records within the period to be averaged they are used to compute 
    the period average.

3)  Added new Quick Start Guide - wview-Quick-Start.html.




1.4.0     06-28-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.2.1

1)  Added support for two new html tags - forecast rule and forecast icon.
    The new tags are <!--forecastRule--> and <!--forecastIcon--> respectively.
    Added a new configuration file, forecast.conf, which allows the user to 
    define the icon files and text associated with the forecast rules. See the 
    example forecast.conf file for details. The icon tag will be replaced by 
    an image html construct pointing at the appropriate icon image file.

2)  Changed Heat Index temperature threshold so it is calculated for 
    temperatures >= 75 degrees F - the old threshold was 80 degrees F. I can 
    find no definitive constraints for the input values of the heat index 
    formula. 75 F seems to be a reasonable starting point.

3)  Added support for different homepage templates based on day or night. 
    If the files "index-day.htx" and "index-night.htx" are listed in 
    /etc/wview/html-templates.conf INSTEAD of "index.htx", then wview will 
    generate the file "index.html" based on the values of sunrise, sunset and 
    the current wview server time. See the example html-templates.conf file 
    in the distro for more details. Also changed index.htx and the two new 
    index-*.htx files just described so that their extensions will be "html"
    instead of "htm" when generated, as it has always been. This only applies 
    to the homepage file generated. If you have a soft link in your webserver 
    document root named "index.html" that points to "index.htm" (as I did),
    you will want to delete that so that htmlgend can generate the "index.html" 
    file directly now.

4)  Added ethernet TCP socket support for VP consoles connected to terminal 
    servers or ethernet-to-serial convertors. Added the parameter 
    "STATION_INTERFACE" to wview.conf so that one of serial or ethernet can 
    be selected. Added "STATION_HOST" and "STATION_PORT" to wview.conf as well
    so the hostname/IP and port number of the terminal server can be specified.
    Confirmed proper operation on an Atop GW21E converter and a Lantronix 
    MSS1-T. Setup of terminal server for proper operation will vary by type 
    and capabilities. Proper serial configuration, transparent data flow (no 
    control character processing), and no packet delimiter are required at a 
    minimum for the terminal server setup. See the User Manual section 
    "Prerequisites" for general requirements.

5)  Confirmed USB operation for 2.4 linux kernels using the flagrantly non-GPL 
    GPL driver from Silicon Labs for the CP2101 device used by Davis for the 
    USB data logger. The driver presents the VP as "/dev/ttyUSB0", thus the 
    serial option should be selected for "STATION_INTERFACE".

6)  Added "wviewconfig" script to distro. This is an interactive script which 
    will ask the user questions and write the wview.conf and htmlgen.conf 
    configuration files based on the answers. It can be run for fresh installs 
    or for upgrades. See the README file for details.

7)  Moved all README content to the new wview-User-Manual.html file.

8)  Integrated a bug fix by Steve Pacenka concerning the new temperature dial 
    when the station is metric.

9)  Fixed a minor annoyance with rain and ET charts that caused the y-axis 
    maximum to be one more step than it should have been when rendered.

10) Improved vpinstall/vpconfig reliability for use with serial, ethernet or 
    USB interfaces. Also added year-to-date rain and ET configuration to 
    vpconfig and the vpinstall script.

11) Added new html tags for station elevation, latitude and longitude. Added 
    the tags to the home page templates as part of the heading. The new tags 
    are: <!--stationElevation-->, <!--stationLatitude--> and 
    <!--stationLongitude--> respectively.





1.3.0     06-15-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.2.0

1)  "YourCity,YourState" has been replaced in the html template files by 
    "<!--stationCity-->,<!--stationState-->" - html tags which wview will 
    replace with the values you specify for "STATION_CITY" and "STATION_STATE" 
    in /etc/wview/htmlgen.conf. So you no longer need to edit every template 
    for your location.

2)  Added PostgreSQL archive support (via radlib-gpl-2.2.0). Note that the 
    configure script option to enable MySQL or now PostgreSQL support has been 
    changed from "--enable-database" to either "--enable-mysql" or 
    "--enable-pgresql" for obvious reasons. There is a full section in the 
    README file that addresses either database setup and building wview for 
    relational database archiving.





1.2.4     06-12-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.1.0

1)  Fixed several exit scenarios when things don't start properly.

2)  Relaxed the timing constraints on the initialization commands to the VP.

3)  Added new graphics - temperature, wind, and humidity "dials".  See the 
    new example images.conf for the entry specifics. Each dial adds some 
    time to generation - embedded users will want to keep this in mind and 
    can of course just not generate them if there is a time issue.

4)  Modified the example HTML templates - removed some odd characters and 
    added the new dial images to the home page templates (index-*).

5)  Added a troubleshooting section to the README file.





1.2.3     06-09-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.1.0

1)  Fixed wvalarmd child signal omission when changing signal handling for 
    1.2.2.





1.2.2     06-09-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.1.0

1)  Changed wind meter image size to ~75% of the previous size. Changed colors 
    and moved direction indicators inside the dial. Made the image background 
    transparent. Generation time improvement of ~ 8%.

2)  Decoupled serial specific logic from the wviewd state machine and 
    initialization. Added "WVIEW_MEDIUM" abstraction with well-defined 
    demarcation points for implementation of non-serial VP interfaces such as
    USB or ethernet. See serial.c and vpinterface.[ch] for details.

3)  Added result checking for png image file generation to detect file save 
    failure (normally a bad IMAGE_PATH setting in htmlgen.conf). Now logs 
    warnings concerning the failure.

4)  Changed all process signal handling to do a more "friendly" job of cleaning 
    up when unrecoverable exceptions occur.

5)  Added SIGPIPE handling to wvalarmd so far-end disconnects can be handled 
    gracefully.





1.2.1     06-06-2005
--------------------

radlib-gpl version required: 2.1.0

1)  Changed default home page template files index.htx and index_Plus.htx.
    The "classic" home page templates have been renamed to index-classic.htx
    and index-classic_Plus.htx. If one prefers the classic look, these files
    can be renamed appropriately when placed in /etc/wview/html. There are 
    new index-*.htx templates for several different backgrounds and layouts.
    The new templates are in examples/html and the new background images are 
    in bin/img. See the "Configuration" section of the README file for a 
    discussion of the templates and a way to rotate your index.htx template. 
    The default index.htx and index_Plus.htx templates are equivalent to the 
    index-clouds.htx style.

2)  Added a TCP/stream socket server interface to wvalarmd to support raw 
    data feed applications. An example data feed client is included which can
    be built and run to illustrate how the socket interface works. The README 
    file is chock full of details for this new capability in the section 
    "Alarms and wview As a Data Feed Engine".

3)  Fixed a bug with generation of newly added extended sensor data historical 
    charts in glchart.c and glmultichart.c.




1.2.0     05-30-2005
--------------------

1)  Added html tags for all extended sensor values supported by the VP 
    console for current conditions. These are:
    
    Solar Radiation
    Extra Temp 1
    Extra Temp 2
    Extra Temp 3
    Soil Temp 1
    Soil Temp 2
    Soil Temp 3
    Soil Temp 4
    Leaf Temp 1
    Leaf Temp 2
    Extra Humidity 1
    Extra Humidity 2
    
    See .../wview-x.y.z/bin/html/parameterlist.txt for the new HTML tags that
    may be placed in your HTML template files.

2)  Changed the bucket and chart title background so that multichart titles
    can be more easily seen.

3)  Fixed vpconfig build problem on Mac OSX.

4)  Added Current Condition Alarms and user-definable alarm actions (scripts).
    Added a new process (wvalarmd) and a corresponding new config file 
    wvalarm.conf to support MIN and MAX alarm thresholds for current condition 
    values provided by the VP console. This facility may be used to control 
    irrigation systems, etc. based on weather data values. It can also be used
    to configure wview as an archive and data feed engine only, for those 
    people who want to do something else with their VP instead of/in addition 
    to generation of a weather web site. The alarm types are:
    
    Barometer
    InsideTemp
    InsideHumidity
    OutsideTemp
    WindSpeed
    TenMinuteAvgWindSpeed
    WindDirection
    OutsideHumidity
    RainRate
    StormRain
    DayRain
    MonthRain
    YearRain
    TxBatteryStatus
    ConsoleBatteryVoltage
    DewPoint
    WindChill
    HeatIndex
    Radiation
    UV
    ET
    ExtraTemp1
    ExtraTemp2
    ExtraTemp3
    SoilTemp1
    SoilTemp2
    SoilTemp3
    SoilTemp4
    LeafTemp1
    LeafTemp2
    ExtraHumid1
    ExtraHumid2

    As always, the README file contains a full description of the alarms 
    implementation and configuration.

5)  Added a new rsync/ssh daemon (wviewsshd) for secure file posting capability
    to one or more remote servers. Utilizing rsync's ability to only transfer
    changes to files, this is significantly faster and more secure than using
    ftp. You must be able to setup the ssh shared key on the remote server - 
    see the README file for full setup details.

6)  Finally, added log message verbosity control. The "VERBOSE_MSGS" parameter
    of the wview.conf configure script now controls all process status log
    production. Set it to "0", and no log output will be generated for normal
    operations by any wview daemon. Error conditions, if they occur, will 
    continue to be logged.




1.1.0     05-14-2005
--------------------

1)  Added Vantage Pro Plus extended data support for historical charts 
    (day, month and year):

    Solar Radiation
    UV
    ET
    LeafTemp1
    LeafTemp2
    LeafWetness1
    LeafWetness2
    SoilTemp1
    SoilTemp2
    SoilTemp3
    SoilTemp4
    ExtraHumidity1
    ExtraHumidity2
    ExtraTemp1
    ExtraTemp2
    ExtraTemp3
    SoilMoisture1
    SoilMoisture2
    SoilMoisture3
    SoilMoisture4

    Extended data chart generation can be enabled/disabled in
    /etc/wview/images.conf (or images-metric.conf if a metric station). HTML
    templates have been added (named *_Plus.htx) which include all of the 
    extended data charts for the VP Plus. These can be edited and included in 
    html-templates.conf so they are generated. Commented out entries for each 
    of the new extended data images have been added to the example images.conf 
    and images-metric.conf files which can be enabled by removing all leading 
    '#' characters for a given image definition.
    See the README file for full details on configuring extended data support.

2)  Simplified htmlgend generator timer initial start offset computation. This
    should tighten up the html generation to always occur on the 10th second.

3)  Cleaned up and improved the HTML templates. Added java function to support
    the 'Weather Summary' URL button on the history pages. Changed history page 
    href's to java buttons in index.htx.

4)  Added support for older VP 'A' archive records (firmware dated before
    April 24, 2002). This is only an issue for VP Plus extended data - 'A' 
    and 'B' records are identical up to 'ET'.

5)  Fixed floating point wierdness causing Heat Index and Wind Chill to
    sometimes have values 0.1 degrees less than the actual temperature for
    cases when they should be equal.




1.0.1     05-01-2005
--------------------

1)  Fixed bug with SQL archive record insertion at midnight caused by how 
    WLK records want the packed time formatted at midnight (24:00 vs. 00:00).

2)  Fixed bug with bad archive record handling of archive interval increment 
    to determine the timestamp for the next archive record from the console. 
    Replaced a legacy hard-coded reference to 5 minute archive intervals with 
    the working value determined from the VP console interface.




1.0.0     04-25-2005
--------------------

1)  Removed CONS_ARCHIVE_INTERVAL configuration option. wview now dynamically
    determines the archive interval the station is using during initialization
    and uses that to prevent the VP station and wview from being out of sync.
    This greatly simplifies installation setup as well. Although the Vantage
    Pro supports archive intervals up to 2 hours, wview supports the 
    following (in minutes): 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60.

2)  Added an optional MySQL database interface for archive records. Requires 
    radlib-gpl-2.0.0 or greater which has been built with database support.
    Configured via new entries in /etc/wview/wview.conf - can store in metric 
    units, can enable or disable extended values such as UV index and solar 
    radiation which are available with the Vantage Pro(2) Plus, and can 
    specify the username, password, and table name used for archive storage.
    See the README file for full details.

3)  Added a new Vantage Pro console setup utility: "vpconfig". The primary
    purpose of vpconfig is to be used by the new install script "vpinstall"
    to setup new VP consoles prior to beginning use of wview. See the README
    file for full details on new setups using "vpinstall".

4)  Disabled NOAA report generation when wview is configured for metric 
    values and units (if METRIC_UNITS[1]=1 in /etc/wview/htmlgen.conf).

5)  Fixed a minor bug that caused chart y scale computation to allow 
    fractional values to cause a point to be plotted below the y axis minimum.




0.9.3     04-09-2005
--------------------

1)  Added metric units and value conversions. This makes wview compatible for 
    non-US installations. A new configuration parameter in htmlgen.conf
    named "METRIC_UNITS" has been added that if set to "1" will cause wview
    to output all images (buckets and charts) as well as all values for HTML
    templates in the metric equivalents. 
    The conversions are:
    
    Temperature ........... Celsius
    Barometer ............. Millibars
    Wind Speed ............ Kilometers per hour
    Rain .................. Centimeters
    Date Format ........... YYYYMMDD
    
    A new image config file named "images-metric.conf" has been added which
    is used instead of "images.conf" if "METRIC_UNITS" is set. This file can
    be edited to translate the English labels, titles and units to any 
    language. By editing this file and the HTML template files, any language
    can be supported by wview. For existing installations, if the 
    "METRIC_UNITS" parameter is not found in htmlgen.conf, wview will assume 
    US units and no conversions will be done. Thus existing US users will not
    be affected by this new feature. In fact one can easily switch back and 
    forth between US and metric units by toggling this configuration value.
    All archive data in the WLK files is still stored in US format - the 
    conversions are only done for real time image and HTML file generation.

2)  Added a new feature to detect Daylight Savings Time changes. If a DST
    change occurs (based on the tm struct component "tm_isdst"), the real
    time data arrays will be automatically updated so that chart data does
    not appear to be 1 hour behind (when DST begins) or one hour ahead
    (when DST ends). If the host system is not configured to automatically 
    make DST time changes, this feature will not be activated and will have 
    no effect.




0.9.2     02-13-2005
--------------------

1)  Implemented a simple barometric pressure trend algorithm for the last 4
    hours of observed values.  Barometer value display will now give an
    indication of the BP trend via the characters "+", "-", "~" immediately
    following the value, i.e. "30.027 + in", "29.921 - in", "30.511 ~ in"
    indicating "rising", "falling", "steady" respectively.
    Indicator may fluctuate in the first few hours after a restart until 
    some history has been built up.

2)  Added multi-plot charts.  Now charts can display several (up to 4) data
    graphs which improves comprehension in select cases such as Temperature 
    and Dewpoint. New images.conf entries can be found in 
    examples/conf/images.conf for Temp/Dew Point and Heat Index/Wind Chill 
    multi-plot charts. Current_Vantage_Pro.htx, Daily_Vantage_Pro.htx and
    Monthly_Vantage_Pro.htx in the bin/html directory have been changed to use 
    these four new charts. 
    Upgraders will want to consider using these files as examples for how to 
    modify their existing configuration and template files (see the file
    "UPGRADE" for more details).
    
3)  Added logic so that for daily and monthly temp-based charts, the min and
    max chart values are normalized.




0.9.1     01-07-2005
--------------------

1)  Removed the history timer. Implemented an event-driven approach so that
    the wviewd process sends a notification message to the htmlgend process
    to indicate that a new archive record has been received. This greatly
    simplifies the history data processing and addresses slow start up 
    scenarios on low power devices.

2)  Added verbage in the README file to discuss HTML generation configuration.

3)  Modified archive retrieval interval timer start mechanism so that it 
    uniformly lands 4 seconds into the next archive interval, as an even 
    divisor of 60 seconds. Thus archive retrieval intervals should be between 
    15 and 60 seconds (inclusive) and divide 60 evenly.

4)  Fixed minor bug with chart boundary calculations.




0.9.0     01-04-2005
--------------------

1)  Modified chart generation to add an argument for number of x-axis "hashes"
    so that chart structure and labeling can be more closely controlled. Also 
    added one data point to chart value arrays and processing to allow for
    the "rightmost" label - thus simplifying other aspects of the old chart 
    generation algorithm.

2)  Fixed a bug when wview is started between an archive minute and the 
    subsequent history timer expiry.

3)  Fixed a bug in line chart rendering when a data point has an undefined 
    value. This was causing GLC_VALUE_NONE (-10000.0) to be graphed.

4)  Modified initial station time synchronization so that it is not 
    synchronized until the wviewd state machine has cycled through one 
    Archive/HiLow/Loop request cycle. Resetting the station time when it is
    in or near the archive minute could have potentially caused record loss, 
    although that has yet to be reported. Now the archive record will be 
    retrieved prior to the time sync.

5)  Cleaned up legacy archive request handling in the wviewd state machine. 
    This code was now being executed because of the time synchronization move 
    (#4). Now the proper handler function is called in both the RUN state and 
    other states.

6)  Optimized chart creation memory allocation.

7)  Enhanced chart min and max boundary calculation so that they fall on
    nice numbers.

8)  Improved some of the titles for charts in the example images.conf file.




0.8.6     12-31-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed bug with computation of dayStart value for html generation causing 
    systems with a 30 minute archive interval to not be computed properly, 
    thus all 24-hour charts were 30 minutes "behind".
    
2)  Changed windchill calculation to require ">" 3.0 mph for wind speed and
    "<" 50 degrees F.




0.8.5     12-29-2004
--------------------

1)  Further optimized image generation by creating finer pitch flags for
    new archive records and what images they impact. Daily charts are updated 
    every archive interval, 28 day charts are updated every hour and 365 day
    charts are updated every day at 12:01 AM.

2)  Changed html generator startup so that it does an initial generation at
    initialization so that images will exist prior to the first generator
    timer expiry (after the next archive record is received).

3)  Updated README file to better reflect recent changes and to describe the
    historical chart generation process.

4)  Fixed run paths in example start scripts.




0.8.4     12-24-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed minor bug in the display of negative values for temp, dewpoint,
    windchill and heatindex.

2)  Optimized image generation so that historical chart images are only 
    updated immediately after a new archive record has been received. This 
    saves about 75% of image generation time when there is no new archive 
    record.

3)  Removed adjustAccuracy function from noaaGenerate.c.




0.8.3     12-15-2004
--------------------

1)  Changed location of run files to /var/wview (/var/run/* can be purged by
    the system).

2)  Changed log output to use CONS_ARCHIVE_INTERVAL for sample message.

3)  Fixed a minor bug with systems brought up for the first time with no
    archive files at all. Also optimized data averaging.

4)  Added compiler optimization value "O2" to default builds.


    

0.8.2     12-14-2004
--------------------

1)  Added Ken McGuire's configurable archive interval changes into the
    main source branch. Now the archive interval of the weather console
    can be configured at build time by specifying "CONS_ARCHIVE_INTERVAL=X"
    to the configure script (X = 5 or X = 30). See the README file for more
    details.
    
2)  Changed (per Ken) the use of "#pragma(pack,1)" to 
    "__attribute__ ((packed))" on several data structures for more portable 
    code.

3)  Abolished the /usr/local/wview directory - now configuration files
    (*.conf, html templates) are located in /etc/wview and run files
    (*.pid, archive, FIFO devices, images, NOAA) are located in 
    /var/wview. This allows the dynamic files under /var to be mounted
    on a ramdisk for embedded applications.

4)  Changed the install-env build target to use the new locations. See the 
    README file for more details.

5)  Added the directory "cross-compile" which includes example configure
    scripts for configuring and building all the libraries necessary for 
    wview and a script for wview itself. See the README file for more 
    cross compiling details.

6)  Added SuSE, FreeBSD, RedHat, and FedoraCore directories under "examples"
    which contain distro/OS specific run control scripts.



    
0.8.1     11-30-2004
--------------------

1)  Converted wview to the GNU autoconf/automake paradigm.
    
    Now the package is built as follows:
    #./configure
    #make
    #make install

    The ftpd daemon executable has been renamed "wviewftpd".
    
    All three daemons (wviewd, htmlgend and wviewftpd) are installed
    in /usr/local/bin by default, although the prefix (=/usr/local)
    can be changed when "configure" is invoked.
    
    make.config, rules.make, and Makefiles have been removed from
    the distro. The "configure" script generates the build files
    based on the host platform.
    
2)  Fixed an annoying text alignment issue for month labels in
    noaaGenerate.c. All labels are now 3 chars long.

    
    

0.8.0     11-21-2004
--------------------

1)  Added the file "make.config" and changed the build environment to
    utilize it.  Linux or BSD can now be specified as well as the 
    install location of the wview daemons.

2)  Added the "pkg" make target and the file "excludefiles" so distro 
    tarballs can be easily built.

3)  Fixed several trivial problems with building on a BSD platform.

4)  Fixed a bug with archive records from the console which contained 
    bogus data - such as when the console loses communication with the 
    wireless data collector.  Now if a bogus record is received from the 
    Vantage Pro Console, data from the last good record is used.
    
    
    

0.7.5     05-02-2004
--------------------

1)  Added a new tag for system up time called <!--wviewUpTime-->
    which will insert the length of time the wview system has
    been running. This release requires radlib-gpl version 1.3.1. 

    
    
    
0.7.4     02-22-2004
--------------------

1)  Found a minor problem with the wind direction calculation
    which would skew the result slightly. The fix requires
    the file $WVIEW_DIRECTORY/noaa.dat to be deleted so that
    it can be correctly regenerated after wview has been
    upgraded and built, but before it is restarted. This MUST
    be done to gain the improvements of the bug fix.
2)  Changed ftpd to use /usr/bin/ftp - a child process is forked
    which calls execv for the ftp binary. This requires a format
    change for the ftp.conf file (which now allows wildcards).
    See the example in .../examples/conf/ftp.conf for the new
    file format. It is possible for multiple instances of the
    ftp binary to run concurrently if the transmission time for
    a file set overlaps the next transmission interval. This was
    not observed to be a problem when tested but care should be
    observed in the rule definitions in ftp.conf. This behavior
    is identical to cron jobs which overlap invocations.




0.7.3     02-18-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed bug #32 - chart data for time frames before archive
    data exists should not be "drawn".
2)  Fixed label problem with rain chart for last 24 hours.
3)  Enhanced sample processing so that the last bar for the
    last 28 days rain chart and the last 365 days rain chart 
    which represent the last current day and current week 
    respectively, are update with each new sample. This allows 
    all of the rain charts to be accurate to the last sample.




0.7.2     02-15-2004
--------------------

1)  Changed rain charts to be bar charts. Rain is expressed as:
    inches/hour for the last 24 hours, inches/day for the last
    28 days, and inches/week for the last 365 days. Chart labels
    found in images.conf should be changed (the new images.conf
    under .../examples/conf has these changes).
2)  Modified wviewd loop packet processing to ignore values of
    "0xFF" or "0xFFFF" in received loop packets from the Vantage
    Pro. These apparently indicate "no reading detected" or
    an RF error.




0.7.1     02-09-2004
--------------------

1)  Ported wview to radlib-gpl version 1.3.0. radlib-gpl now has
    its own homepage, www.radlib.teel.ws, for reference documents
    and other support. Download radlib-gpl-1.3.0 from the homepage
    and build it per the instructions in the distribution README
    for radlib-gpl before installing and building this version of
    wview. The wview homepage will now specify the version of
    radlib-gpl required for the current version of wview.




0.7.0     02-04-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed bug #26 - Monthly "Low Humidity" was always zero.
2)  Renamed all radlib references and build against new GPL version
    of radlib.  radlib must now be built separately (and before)
    wview.  radlib can now be located anywhere and the env variable
    "RADLIB_SRC_BASE" is no longer required at all. Headers and
    the library file are stored under "/usr/local/include" and
    "/usr/local/lib" respectively. The new radlib version is
    1.2 and the distro tree is rooted at "radlib-gpl". The README
    file has been updated (and simplified) accordingly.
3)  Added GPL headers and the "COPYING" file which contains the
    GPL version 2 license. wview is now officially GPL software.




0.6.3     02-01-2004
--------------------

1)  Improved wind direction averaging by using a consensus averaging
    algorithm. This corrects the problem where 1 degree and 359 degrees
    would normally average to 180 (south), when in fact we want them
    to average 0 (north). This is deployed for all instances of wind
    direction averaging: 24 hour, 28 day, and 365 day charts, and
    NOAA reports.
2)  Cleaned up some NOAA report formatting.




0.6.2     01-29-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed a few annoyances in the generated NOAA reports such as
    "DEP FROM NORM" values.
2)  Improved normal values calculation to handle case of no historical
    data.
3)  Added <!--wviewVersion--> html tag so that the version of wview
    is available for html templates to use. This requires the
    "globalWviewVersionStr" macro to be changed for each new release
    in ../common/sysdefs.h.
4)  Added a new html template: .../bin/html/index.htx. This is a
    good starting point for a weather home page. It includes the
    new <!--wviewVersion--> tag so the wview version can be displayed.
    It also includes some nifty javascript code for picking NOAA
    reports from drop down lists (thanks SSM!). It references other
    generated html files such as Current_Vantage_Pro.htm.



0.6.1     01-28-2004
--------------------

1)  Added enhancement #22 - NOAA monthly and yearly historical reports
    are now generated and placed where the other image and html files
    are located. The files are named "NOAA-<year>.text" and
    "NOAA-<year>-<month>.txt". This capability is implemented in
    noaaGenerate.[ch] in the htmlgenerator directory.
2)  Added a recovery state for serial read errors.



0.6.0     01-21-2004
--------------------

1)  Added enhancement #19 - html generator images and htmls can now be
    configured by the user. The source files "images-user.[ch]" can be
    modified and saved outside the source tree during upgrades (then
    copied back in the source tree) so that users can easily save their
    customized image creation source and config files. This requires
    new config files "images.conf" (for built-in generators), 
    "images-user.conf" (for user defined generators), and "html-templates.conf"
    (to define which html templates to generate). See README for complete
    details.



0.5.4     01-17-2004
--------------------

1)  Actually fixed Bug #8!



0.5.3     01-17-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed bug in ftp process where FtpClose was being called when a file
    failed to transfer, instead of continuing to the next file.
2)  Modified ftplib.c to not malloc memory for each file, but rather use
    a static buffer.
3)  Tested more thoroughly against remote ftp server.
4)  Changed ftplib to use system buffers and not malloc all over creation.
5)  Fixed Bug #17 - partial write bug in ftplib so it continues to transfer 
    when the far end abates (stalls).
6)  Fixed memory leak in ftplib.
7)  Fixed Bug #8 - shift forward day chart samples by one sample.



0.5.2     01-12-2004
--------------------

1)  Changed FTP process to always start in the same minute as history timer.
    This guarantees that ftp.conf intervals coincide with <min> % 5 = 1.
2)  Changed ftp.conf file format to specify host, user, and pass once at
    the top of the file.
3)  Changed ftpUtils.c to only connect and login once per transmit interval 
    (minute).



0.5.1     01-11-2004
--------------------

1)  Improved archive path request processing so that the wviewd daemon does
    not respond until it has stored all archive records during initial start-up
2)  Added ftp process to allow moving images to remote server (see README)
3)  Refined generator data and history timers to more accurately sync to a
    millisecond offset



0.4.3     01-06-2004
--------------------

1)  Removed Davis SDK directory
2)  added vantageSDK directory
3)  created "install-env" target for first time installation



0.4.2     01-06-2004
--------------------

1)  Fixed chart spikes
2)  added time synchronization for the console clock
3)  added top level makefile
4)  fixed dbfGetAverages "wrap-around" file bug
5)  fixed add history sample bugs



0.4.1     12-31-2003
--------------------

1)  Fixed shutdown nuisance - wview script now starts and stops cleanly
2)  added SSM chart label changes (moved startDay up 5 mins, startMonth
    up 1 hour, and startYear up 1 day so the last label is correct)



0.4.0     12-31-2003
--------------------

1)  Removed pnggen directory from project - link against system libraries,
    build against /usr/local/include



0.3.1     12-31-2003
--------------------

1)  Fixed midnight wakeup failure
2)  added wait in html initialization for the daemon process



0.2.1     12-15-2003
--------------------

1)  Cleaned up the pnggen build environment



0.1.0     12-12-2003
--------------------

1)  Initial version
